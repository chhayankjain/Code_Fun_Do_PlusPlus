The Challenge - Predict,Detect or Manage Natural Disasters

Stark101's Proposal:

Usually, it takes a lot of time for the disaster management authorities to be notified about any natural disaster that might have taken place. 

For example: https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-fast-does-earthquake-information-get-posted-web-site-get-sent-out-earthquake-notification?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products
suggests that it might take upto 20 minutes in some areas to know whether there has been an earthquaqe in that part of the world. In this project we aim to provide a solution to the same.

The live feed provided by the government owned surveilance tools (cameras/satelite data) are periodically scanned frame wise. The frames captured are checked for any anomalies. If any serious event is detected, the concerned authorities are immediately pinged to look into the situation, and take the required action.

Since this is done periodically (say every 30 seconds), the communication gap is bridged between the concerned authorities and the line of action and quick relief can be brought to the affected area.

We at Stark101 sincerely hope to implement this solution because this methodology can bring about quick relief where every minute is precious.
